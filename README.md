# Chatapk

This app will create a simple chat room where users can send messages to each other. To use the app, you will need to start the server by running the following command:


python texting_app.py


Once the server is running, you can connect to it using any other computer or device that has Python installed. To connect to the server, run the following command:

python client.py


When you connect to the server, you will be prompted to enter a username. Once you have entered a username, you can start sending messages to other users. To send a message, type the message and press enter. The message will be sent to all other users who are connected to the server.

To exit the app, type q and press enter.

This is just a simple example of a texting app that you can create in Python. You can add more features to the app, such as the ability to create groups, send files, and so on.
